# Learning ESLint
## Let's learn an ESLint Rule
This rule is important because it gives a consistent way to write code in JavaScript. When semicolons are automatically inserted it can end up causing issues, especially if the person working in the program doesn't expect or understand the automatic insertion. This rule can prevent errors in the syntax which is always helpful.
